# Real-Time Object Detection using YOLO (Colab)

This project demonstrates object detection using YOLOv8, executed in a cloud-based GPU environment (Google Colab).

## Tech Stack
- Python
- YOLOv8
- OpenCV
- Google Colab (GPU)

## Features
- Object detection on images
- Pre-trained YOLO model
- GPU-accelerated inference

## Results
Example detection output included in repository.

## Notes
All experiments were conducted using Google Colab to ensure reproducibility without local hardware constraints.
